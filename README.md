# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

**Welcome!** This repo houses my first case study using the R programming language. It is a case study of a fictional bike sharing company called Cyclistic, and the business task I've been asked to solve for is:

I will figure this out by analysing the last 12 months of cyclistic's bike usage data (*stored in the "data" folder*). Check out the **Bike Share Analysis.Rmd** file for my analysis.
